Analysis of coral disturbance dynamics on the Great Barrier Reef (1995-2017) as presented in MacNeil et al. (2019) Water-quality limits on resilience of the Great Barrier Reef. Nature Ecology & Evolution XXX:XXX-XXX.

This repo includes all data and files needed to reproduce the analysis and figures in the published paper, typically as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks. Analysis was conducted using the [Python](https://www.python.org) library [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io), which will need to be installed along with dependencies. 

To replicate the analysis, Jupyter notebooks should be run in this order:

1. Hughes_etal_2018_analysis.ipynb
2. Hughes_etal_2018_plots.ipynb
3. GBR_empirical_disturbance_rates.ipynb
4. GBR_coral_model.ipynb
5. GBR_future_simulations.ipynb
6. GBR_coral_plots.ipynb
